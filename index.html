            <h1>Without Limits</h1>
            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development...</p>

            <h1>Global Community</h1>
            <p>A developer community generally defined is a group of developers gathered in a place to achieve a common
                goal.
                OK, you want to know what that looks like. I can understand that. The purpose of a developer community
                and the pieces that build the community puzzle are complex and different for each unique case. Developer
                communities usually stem from a general problem of information silos, senior developers spending their
                days answering questions rather than coding, or product teams creating things that their communities and
                customers donâ€™t actually need or want.</p>
